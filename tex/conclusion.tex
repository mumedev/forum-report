% CONCLUSION
\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

In this report we started by looking at an initial idea for an application from a user's perspective. We listed a user story and story board, and discussed a number of important use cases. Finally we also described the flow of the application through a screen transition diagram.

Next we started elaborating the application from the perspective of the software engineer. How should data be organized and how should the consumers and producers communicate? Briefly investigating several trade-offs, we came to a global architecture of the application. Within this global infrastructure, we worked our way up from the data to the server and finally to each of the client applications. The implementation of each of these components was explained. Some key points were also illustrated by code examples.

The following chapter focused mainly on the differences between mobile web and native applications. The lack of a real comparison between Android and iOS technologies is a weakness in this report, along with the limited code base. Nonetheless, I hope to have provided at least some useful insights about mobile computing and technology.
